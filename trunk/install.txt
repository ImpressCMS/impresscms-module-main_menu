How to install Main_Menu
=============================

Main_Menu is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /main_menu folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Main_Menu icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.
